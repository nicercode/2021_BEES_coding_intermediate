# The UNSW School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences introduction to data manipulation and visulaization in R (INTERMEDIATE)

This repository contains content for a 2 day course for HDR students (and other interesting people), run within the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences (BEES) at the University of New South Wales. 

## Aims & Content


Broad theme: Scaling up your analyses: how to get R to repeat the same task many times (possibly with different inputs) and organize the output in a useful way.

This general coding skill could apply to processing lots of files from imaging or surveys or to simulations (statistical or individual-based) or to lots of observational data.  In general with medium-sized data projects you'll often find yourself having to repeat the same thing over and over and it's good to learn how to get R to do this in an organized and efficient manner.  There are lots of new powerful tools, but they take a bit of coding practice to learn.  


Monday 24 May = for loops & purrr
Tuesday 25 May = writing your own functions
